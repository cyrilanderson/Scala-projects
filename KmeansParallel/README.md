# KmeansParallel
Implementation of parallel k-means clustering algorithm and application to image compression (by performing k-means clustering on pixel colors). Parallelizing computation of distances to compute nearest centroids and updating of the centroids. Application â€“ using k Means clustering to compress digital image via a mapping of image color space to k clusters. Completed as weekly assignment in online course in Parallel programming in Scala
